User space for common code for my Lily58 and Kyria.

TODO:
* Standard combos work now but the custom ones needs to 
  be moved from the lily keymap to the user space.

* Fix the rest of the keymap, especially sort out the 
  thumb buttons and move back to previous bspc...

* Add combo debugging to the oled
